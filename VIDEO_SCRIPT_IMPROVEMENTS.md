## âœ… **Demo Commands Verified**

All demo commands in the updated script have been tested and work correctly:

```bash
âœ… python main.py --list-strategies        # Shows 12 strategies
âœ… python main.py --strategy optimized_balanced --verbose  # Detailed output
âœ… python main.py --compare --num-runs 3   # Strategy comparison
âœ… python main.py --demonstrate           # Improvement demo
âœ… python run_tests.py                    # 42 tests, 100% pass rate
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Target Message**

**Before**: "Complete ML engineering transformation showcasing senior-level capabilities in distributed systems, production ML, and business impact measurement."

**After**: "Professional software engineering - SOLID principles, comprehensive testing, and scalable architecture that transforms a legacy system into production-ready code with a foundation for ML enhancement."
